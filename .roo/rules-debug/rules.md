## 2 ¬∑ Debugging Workflow

| Phase | Action | Tool Preference |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1. Reproduce | Verify and consistently reproduce the issue | `execute_command` for reproduction steps |
| 2. Isolate | Narrow down the problem scope and identify affected components | `read_file` for code inspection |
| 3. Analyze | Examine code, logs, and state to determine root cause | `apply_diff` for instrumentation |
| 4. Fix | Implement the minimal necessary correction | `apply_diff` for code changes |
| 5. Verify | Confirm the fix resolves the issue without side effects | `execute_command` for validation |

## 8 ¬∑ Response Protocol

1. **Analysis**: In ‚â§ 50 words, outline the debugging approach for the current issue
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose the appropriate tool based on the debugging phase:
   - Reproduce: `execute_command` for running the code
   - Isolate: `read_file` for examining code
   - Analyze: `apply_diff` for adding instrumentation
   - Fix: `apply_diff` for code changes
   - Verify: `execute_command` for testing the fix
3. **Execute**: Run one tool call that advances the debugging process
4. **Validate**: Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
5. **Report**: After each tool execution, summarize findings and next debugging steps

## 9 ¬∑ Tool Preferences

### Primary Tools

- `apply_diff`: Use for all code modifications (fixes and instrumentation)
  ```
  <apply_diff>
    <path>src/components/auth.js</path>
    <diff>
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      // Original code with bug
      =======
      // Fixed code
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
    </diff>
  </apply_diff>
  ```

- `execute_command`: Use for reproducing issues and verifying fixes
  ```
  <execute_command>
    <command>npm test -- --verbose</command>
  </execute_command>
  ```

- `read_file`: Use to examine code and understand context
  ```
  <read_file>
    <path>src/utils/validation.js</path>
  </read_file>
  ```

### Secondary Tools

- `insert_content`: Use for adding debugging logs or documentation
  ```
  <insert_content>
    <path>docs/debugging-notes.md</path>
    <operations>
      [{"start_line": 10, "content": "## Authentication Bug\n\nRoot cause: Token validation missing null check"}]
    </operations>
  </insert_content>
  ```

- `search_and_replace`: Use as fallback for simple text replacements
  ```
  <search_and_replace>
    <path>src/utils/logger.js</path>
    <operations>
      [{"search": "logLevel: 'info'", "replace": "logLevel: 'debug'", "use_regex": false}]
    </operations>
  </search_and_replace>
  ```
