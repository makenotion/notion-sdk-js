# Introduction to using Notion's SDK for JavaScript

## Learn how to make public API requests

Use this sample code to learn how to make public API requests with varying degrees of difficulty.

The sample code is split into three sections:

1. basic
2. intermediate
3. advanced

If you are new to Notion's SDK for JavaScript, start with the code samples in the `/basic` directory to get more familiar to basic concepts.

The files in each directory will build on each other to increase in complexity. For example, in `/intermediate`, first you will see how to create a database, then how to create a database and add a page to it, and finally create a database, add a page, and query/sort the database.

The `/advanced` section contains standalone examples and do not build on each other.

## Table of contents

In case you are looking for example code of a specific task, the files are divided as follows:

- `/basic/1-new-block.js`: Create a new block that will be appended to an existing Notion page.
- `/basic/2-add-linked-block.js`: Add a link to the text of a new block.
- `/basic/3-styled-block-text.js`: Include styles for a new block's text.
- `/intermediate/1-create-a-database.js`: Create a new database with defined properties.
- `/intermediate/2-add-page-to-database.js`: Add new pages to a newly-created database.
- `/intermediate/3-query-database.js`: Create a new database with defined properties, add pages to it, and filter the database entries (pages).
- `/intermediate/4-sort-database.js`: Create a new database with defined properties, add pages to it, and filter/sort the database entries (pages).
- `/advanced/` // todo: these have not been added yet

## Running locally

### 1. Clone project and install dependencies

To use this example on your machine, clone the repo and move into your local copy:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js.git
cd /notion-sdk-js
```

Next, move into this example in the `/examples` directory, and install its dependencies:

```zsh
cd /examples/intro-to-notion-api
npm install
```

### 2. Set your environment variables in a `.env` file

A `.env.example` file has been included and can be renamed `.env` (or you can run `cp .env.example .env` to copy the file).

Update the environment variables below:

```zsh
NOTION_API_KEY=<your-notion-api-key>
NOTION_PAGE_ID=<notion-page-id>
```

`NOTION_API_KEY`: Create a new integration in the [integrations dashboard](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations) and retrieve the API key from the integration's `Secrets` page.

`NOTION_PAGE_ID`: Use the ID of any Notion page that you don't mind having content added to. A page specifically for testing is recommended.

The page ID is the 32 character string at the end of any page URL.

### 3. Give the integration access to your page

Your Notion integration will need permission to interact with the Notion page being used for your `NOTION_PAGE_ID` variable. To provide access, do the following:

1. Go to the page in your workspace.
2. Click the `•••` (more menu) on the top-right corner of the page.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the menu and click `Add connections`.
4. Search for and select your integration in the `Search for connections...` menu.

Once selected, your integration will have permission to read content from the page.

**If you are receiving authorization errors, make sure the integration has permission to access the page.**

### 3. Run individual examples

To run each individual example, use the `node` command with the file's path.

For example:

```zsh
node /basic/1-new-block.js
```

To learn more, read the [public API docs](https://developers.notion.com/) for additional information on using Notion's API. The API docs include a series of [guides](https://developers.notion.com/docs) and the [API reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro), which has a full list of available endpoints.

To see more examples of what you can build with Notion, see our other sample integrations in the parent `/examples` directory.
